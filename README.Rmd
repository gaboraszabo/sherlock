# sherlock

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The __{sherlock} R package__ provides powerful graphical displays and statistical tools to aid structured problem solving and diagnosis. It is designed to seamlessly work with the `tidyverse` set of packages.


_"That is to say, nature's laws are causal; they reveal themselves by comparison and difference, and they operate at every multi-variate space-time point" - Edward Tufte_





## Installation

You can install the development version of sherlock from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gaborszabo11/sherlock")
```

## Functions

While the package is currently under development, a few functions are already available and ready to be used. Available functions are as follows:


#### Plotting functions
`draw_multivari_plot()`

`draw_youden_plot()`

`draw_small_multiples`

`draw_cartesian_small_multiples()`

`draw_polar_small_multiples()`

`draw_timeseries_scatterplot()`




#### Helper functions
`normalize_observations()`

`theme_sherlock()`

`scale_color_sherlock()`

`scale_fill_sherlock()`

`draw_horizontal_reference_line()`

`draw_vertical_referencew_line()`



## Examples

Here are a few examples:
```{r}
# Loading libraries
library(sherlock)
library(ggh4x)
```



```{r example}
multi_vari_data %>% 
  draw_multivari_plot(response = force, factor_1 = cycle, factor_2 = fixture, factor_3 = line)
```



```{r}
library(sherlock)
library(ggh4x)

multi_vari_data_2 %>% 
  draw_multivari_plot(response = Length, factor_1 = Part, factor_2 = Operator, plot_means = TRUE)
```




```{r}
youden_plot_data_2 %>% 
  draw_youden_plot(x_axis_var = gage_1, y_axis_var = gage_2, median_line = TRUE, 
                   x_axis_label = "Gage 1", y_axis_label = "Gage 2")
```


```{r}
youden_plot_data %>% 
  draw_youden_plot(x_axis_var = measurement_1, y_axis_var = measurement_2, 
                   grouping_var = location, x_axis_label = "Trial 1", y_axis_label = "Trial 2")
```



```{r}
timeseries_scatterplot_data %>%
  draw_timeseries_scatterplot(y_var = y, grouping_var_1 = date, grouping_var_2 = cavity, faceting = TRUE, 
                              control_limits = TRUE, alpha = 0.07, interactive = FALSE)
```
